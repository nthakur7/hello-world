This is a repository exercise to get all our software builders in-sync on using GitHub to collaborate.
If you maded this far, you are one step closer to setting up your software development environment.
Play with the tool, to get familiar on how to
 * create a "branch" from the main trunk to make changes, 
 * make a "commit" to the changes,
 * open a "pull request" to compare the changes from the main trunk,
 * "merge" a pull request back into main.

Detail examples can be found at "https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/".
Don't forget to also get the latest Android Studio (Version 2.2, as of 9/19/2016).

Congrats!!
